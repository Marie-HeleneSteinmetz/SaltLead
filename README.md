This is my mini project for my Configuration Management Systems course in Haaga-Helia. The idea of the assignment is that I'm supposed to have a real life "issue" that I can resolve with the Salt Master Minion Managment tool.

The assignment in total is found on: https://terokarvinen.com/2022/palvelinten-hallinta-2022p2/

The idea of the assignment is based n the needs I have found in my everyday
work day.
I work as a Technicla Support Specialist at a SaaS company that provide VoIP
(Voice over IP). 

Sometimes ppl that use the applikation  isin't the most Technical and this
 sometimes cause issues when troubleshooting their problems. 


It can requre a lot of work to get them to download the application
 and the troubleshooting tools.
The idea is that the salt master can distribute the folders to new workers,
 make sure they have the tools and updates that they need to run the program
 and if issues areise they can download the troubleshooting tools.

I have made 2 scrips with links in them:
1. That contain the link to download the applikation and the troubleshooting tools that are found on the homepage. 
2. One script that contain the actual development a sales speech. In my version it contains a link to how to build a sales speech. 
3. 

I have created the folder in salt and one bash file that I have tried locally on my VM. 
I have also created a init.sls where is an apache update and the folder that I want to run. 
This does not work yet tho. I get an error.
I decided to make all the .sh files first, run them locally and on tomorrows lesson get answers why I do not get it to work.
